		<h2> The "Git" in GitHub</h2>
<p> To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.
So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.
Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use them. Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar method is pretty common for downloading needed files—especially in preparation for compiling a program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).
Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available. It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better. If you’re interested in knowing the details, the Git Basics page has a thorough explanation on how Git works.</p>

	<h2> The "Hub"in GIt Hub</h2>
<p> We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.
Let’s go over a few of the main reasons that geeks like to use GitHub, and learn some terminology along the way.
</p>
	<h2>Repository </h2>
<p> A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.</p>







	<p>you are in a software development industry, then, most likely you have heard about GitHub, a repository hosting service for Git that also has a web-based graphical interface. Today, I would like to discuss it and mention key benefits you get from using Github.GitHub, can be divided into the Git, and the Hub. The service includes access controls as well as a number of collaboration features like tools for basic task management and for all projects you handle. GitHub hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. So, the “Git” implies the version control system; a tool which allows developers to keep track of the constant revisions to their code. The “Hub” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code. It’s definitely something worth looking into!</p>
